# Excel-Project-Kickstart
# 1.Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?


# First conclusions is;
When we look at the data we have, we see that the total number of companies is ‘4114’. In this way, we look at inside the total number we can see ‘2185’ of them are Successful, ‘1530’ of them are Failed, ‘349’ of them are Canceled and ‘50’ of them are still alive.If we look at in a percentile of the total number ‘53.11% Successful, 37.19% Failed, 8.48% Canceled and 1.22% is still alive’. When we look at the graphic below, we see that the great majority of Successful companies are in the category of theater, music, film&video. The interesting thing is that the great majority of Successful companies are in the theater category, but also most of the failed companies are in the theater category too.

# Second conclusion is, if we look at the another graphic below again:
This time we can see ‘41’ of different sub-category individually.We can see that the biggest success and failure are in the games part.Also other two great successful majority is in the documentary and rock sub-category.Another interesting thing is, all companies in this sub-category are successful.If we look at the other two big failed companies, in animations and video games sub-category. Also there is no other options here, all companies is in this field they failed.

# Third conclusion is, if  we look at the another graphic below is says;
When we reach the number of successful in the year to months, we see that the great majority of the successful companies are in May.Another hand in December, there is a serious decrease in the number of successful companies.On the other hand, we observe that those who failed have increased in Jan, Jun, Aug and Oct. Also lowest failure rate is in April. Apart from June, we see that there is not much difference in other months those canceled.

# 2.What are some limitations of this dataset?

First of all start, end dates and goal, for example in order for a company to be truly successful, it must have a profit in the long run and grow. Of course, this period varies according to the field of activity of company. So we need to know exactly what the companies short and long term goals are.
Secondly State part it can be more detailed. For example, total number of population and distribution of these numbers by location(Town, County,etc…).
We can increase these examples even more, like a the expectations of the investors or promotions discounts to increase sales etc. The data we have is not sufficient for a more detailed and realistic analysis.

# 3.What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

If we only look at the summer and winter months in the year, we can see which categories and sub-category are successful or failed. For example, we can see the difference more specific between the number of the movies in the winter and summer times. The number will increase in Winter time also decrease in the Summer time.
Also if we examine the ‘Plays’ part by removing it from the graphics, we can gain another viewpoint because it is the most popular sub-category.

# 4.Only if all the statistics are shown plus a line or two explaining why you chose mean or median?

When we look at the mean number, I see more clearly why successful campaigns  more than failed campaigns because of the more Backers.
